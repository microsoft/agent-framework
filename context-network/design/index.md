# Design Documents

## Purpose
This index provides navigation to design documents that describe implementation patterns, technical designs, and architectural details for the Microsoft Agent Framework.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Design
- **Stability:** Semi-stable
- **Abstraction:** Structural
- **Confidence:** Established

## Design Documents

### Python Implementation

1. **[Python Package Setup](python-package-setup.md)**
   - Topic: Python package structure, dependency management, and build configuration
   - Covers: uv usage, namespace packages, import structure, testing setup

## About Design Documents

Design documents provide detailed technical descriptions of how features are implemented or should be implemented. They differ from ADRs in that they focus on the "how" rather than the "why" of decisions.

### When to Create Design Documents

Create a design document when:
- Implementing a complex feature that requires detailed technical planning
- Documenting existing complex implementations for maintainability
- Providing implementation guidance for contributors
- Explaining technical patterns used across the codebase

### Design Document Structure

While flexible, design documents typically include:
- **Overview**: High-level description of what is being designed
- **Goals**: What the design aims to achieve
- **Technical Details**: Detailed implementation information
- **Code Examples**: Illustrative code snippets
- **Diagrams**: Visual representations when helpful
- **Considerations**: Edge cases, limitations, trade-offs
- **References**: Related ADRs, specs, or external documentation

## Relationship Network
- **Prerequisite Information**:
  - [Architecture Overview](../foundation/architecture.md)
- **Related Information**:
  - [Decision Records](../decisions/index.md)
  - [Specifications](../specs/index.md)
- **Dependent Information**:
  - Domain-specific documentation
  - Implementation code

## Navigation Guidance
- **Access Context**: When implementing features or understanding technical details
- **Common Next Steps**:
  - Understanding decisions → [Decision Records](../decisions/index.md)
  - Implementation → Domain documentation ([Python](../domains/python/index.md), [.NET](../domains/dotnet/index.md))
  - Process → [Development Processes](../processes/development.md)
- **Related Tasks**: Feature implementation, code reviews, refactoring
