## Critical Path (Sequential Execution Required)

1. **TASK-301** â†’ Workflow Graph Data Structure
2. **TASK-302** â†’ Workflow Executor Base
3. **TASK-306** â†’ Workflow State Machine
4. **TASK-311** â†’ Integration Tests

**Note**: These tasks must be completed sequentially as each builds on the previous.

## Parallel Work Opportunities

**Group A** (After TASK-301):
- TASK-304 (Checkpoint Storage Interface)

**Group B** (After TASK-302):
- TASK-303 (Workflow Event System)
- TASK-308 (RequestInfoExecutor)

**Group C** (After TASK-304):
- TASK-305 (InMemoryCheckpointStorage)
- TASK-307 (Graph Signature Validation)

**Group D** (After TASK-302 + TASK-303):
- TASK-309 (Workflow Streaming)

**Group E** (After TASK-301 + TASK-304 + TASK-306):
- TASK-310 (Workflow Serialization)

## Phase Completion Criteria

Before proceeding to Phase 5, verify:

- [ ] Can create and execute conditional workflows
- [ ] Can create checkpoints and restore workflow state
- [ ] Can stream workflow events in real-time
- [ ] Can pause workflow for human-in-the-loop
- [ ] Can serialize and deserialize workflows
- [ ] Graph signature validation prevents incompatible checkpoints

### Documentation
