# Task Guides

Guidelines and templates for creating and executing tasks in the TypeScript implementation project.

## Available Guides

### [Task Structure Template](./task-structure-template.md)
Standard format that all task files must follow. Includes sections for objectives, context references, implementation requirements, test requirements, and acceptance criteria.

### [Task Granularity Guidelines](./task-granularity.md)
How to size tasks appropriately for agent/developer execution. Covers the 2-8 hour rule, single responsibility principle, and when to split or merge tasks.

### [Quality Gates](./quality-gates.md)
Phase completion criteria and quality standards that must be met before proceeding to the next phase. Includes coverage requirements, type checking, and review processes.

### [Context Minimization](./context-minimization.md)
Strategies for writing self-contained tasks that require minimal additional context. Covers inline references, explicit standards, and decision pre-loading.

### [Estimation Tracking](./estimation-tracking.md)
How to track estimated vs actual time, calculate variance, and improve future estimates based on historical data.

## Quick Start

**Creating a new task?**
1. Start with [Task Structure Template](./task-structure-template.md)
2. Apply [Task Granularity Guidelines](./task-granularity.md)
3. Use [Context Minimization](./context-minimization.md) strategies

**Executing tasks?**
1. Read the task file (it's self-contained)
2. Follow the implementation requirements
3. Meet all acceptance criteria
4. Check against [Quality Gates](./quality-gates.md)

**Reviewing tasks?**
1. Verify structure matches [Task Structure Template](./task-structure-template.md)
2. Check granularity per [Task Granularity Guidelines](./task-granularity.md)
3. Ensure quality gates are met per [Quality Gates](./quality-gates.md)
