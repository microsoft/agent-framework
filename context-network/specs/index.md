# Specifications

## Purpose
This index provides navigation to specification documents that define requirements, features, and integrations for the Microsoft Agent Framework.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Specifications
- **Stability:** Semi-stable
- **Abstraction:** Detailed
- **Confidence:** Established

## Specifications

1. **[001: Foundry SDK Alignment](001-foundry-sdk-alignment.md)**
   - Topic: Alignment with Azure AI Foundry SDK
   - Status: Active
   - Covers: Integration points, compatibility requirements, API alignment

2. **[002: TypeScript Implementation Feature Parity](002-typescript-feature-parity.md)**
   - Topic: TypeScript/JavaScript implementation specification
   - Status: Proposed
   - Covers: Complete feature parity analysis, architecture, package structure, implementation roadmap

## About Specifications

Specifications define requirements, features, or integration points in detail. They serve as the source of truth for what a feature should do and how it should behave.

### When to Create Specifications

Create a specification when:
- Defining a new major feature before implementation
- Documenting integration requirements with external systems
- Establishing API contracts and behavior
- Providing detailed requirements for complex features

### Specification Structure

Use the provided [spec-template.md](spec-template.md) as a starting point. Typical sections include:
- **Summary**: Brief overview of what is being specified
- **Motivation**: Why this specification is needed
- **Requirements**: Detailed functional and non-functional requirements
- **API/Interface**: Proposed interfaces or APIs
- **Examples**: Usage examples
- **Considerations**: Edge cases, security, performance
- **Alternatives**: Other approaches considered
- **References**: Related ADRs, designs, or external specs

## Relationship Network
- **Prerequisite Information**:
