        Here is the request:

        " & Topic.NewTask & "

        Here is the pre-survey:

            1. Please list any specific facts or figures that are GIVEN in the request itself. It is possible that there are none.
            2. Please list any facts that may need to be looked up, and WHERE SPECIFICALLY they might be found. In some cases, authoritative sources are mentioned in the request itself.
            3. Please list any facts that may need to be derived (e.g., via logical deduction, simulation, or computation)
            4. Please list any facts that are recalled from memory, hunches, well-reasoned guesses, etc.

        When answering this survey, keep in mind that 'facts' will typically be specific names, dates, statistics, etc. Your answer should use headings:

            1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS
            2. FACTS TO LOOK UP
            3. FACTS TO DERIVE
            4. EDUCATED GUESSES

        DO NOT include any other headings or sections in your response. DO NOT list next steps or plans until asked to do so."]

            - Is the request fully satisfied? (True if complete, or False if the original request has yet to be SUCCESSFULLY and FULLY addressed)
            - Are we in a loop where we are repeating the same requests and / or getting the same responses from an agent multiple times? Loops can span multiple turns, and can include repeated actions like scrolling up or down more than a handful of times.
            - Are we making forward progress? (True if just starting, or recent messages are adding value. False if recent messages show evidence of being stuck in a loop or if there is evidence of significant barriers to success such as the inability to read from a required file)
            - Who should speak next? (select from: " & Concat(Topic.AvailableAgents, name, ",") & ") 
            - What instruction or question would you give this team member? (Phrase as if speaking directly to them, and include any specific information they may need)
