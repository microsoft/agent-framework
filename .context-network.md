# Microsoft Agent Framework - Context Network

## Location
The context network for this project is located at: `context-network/`

## Purpose
This context network contains all planning documents, architectural decisions, design documentation, specifications, and team coordination information for the Microsoft Agent Framework project.

## What Goes in the Context Network?

**Context Network (Team Memory) - ALL of these MUST go here:**
- Architecture diagrams and system design descriptions
- Implementation plans and strategies
- Project roadmaps and planning documents
- Technical decision records (ADRs)
- Design documentation and specifications
- Research findings and investigations
- Task delegation documents
- Meeting notes and team coordination

**Project Files (Build Artifacts) - These stay in the main project structure:**
- Source code files (Python, .NET)
- Configuration for build tools
- Resource files used by the application
- Public documentation for end users (README, CONTRIBUTING, etc.)
- Deployment scripts
- Tests
- Sample code and tutorials

## For AI Agents

When working with this repository:

1. **ALWAYS consult the context network** before implementing new features or making architectural decisions
2. **Planning documents belong in the context network**, not in the project root or scattered throughout the codebase
3. **Document your decisions** in the appropriate section (decisions/, design/, specs/)
4. **Update relationship maps** when creating dependencies between components
5. **Check existing ADRs** before proposing changes to established patterns

Think of it this way:
- **Context Network = Blueprints**: Where we plan, design, and document decisions
- **Project Files = Building**: The actual code that runs and ships to users
