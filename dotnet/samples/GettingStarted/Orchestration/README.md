# Orchestration - Multi-Agent Coordination Patterns

Examples of orchestrating multiple agents to work together in coordinated workflows. These samples demonstrate various orchestration patterns including sequential processing, concurrent execution, group chat scenarios, and handoff mechanisms between agents. The examples show how to build complex AI systems where multiple agents collaborate, share context, and handle sophisticated multi-step tasks that require coordination and state management.
