# Agent with Custom Implementation

This sample demonstrates how to create a fully custom agent implementation without relying on external AI services.

## Overview

The sample creates a simple "parrot" agent that:
- Converts user input to uppercase
- Supports both synchronous and streaming invocation modes
- Demonstrates the complete implementation requirements for a custom agent

This pattern is useful when you need to:
- Integrate with custom AI models or services
- Create rule-based agents without AI
- Build agents with specific custom logic
