# Agent Framework with OpenAI

These samples show how to use the Agent Framework with the OpenAI exchange types.

By default, the .Net version of Agent Framework uses the [Microsoft.Extensions.AI.Abstractions](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.AI.Abstractions/) exchange types.

For developers who are using the [OpenAI SDK](https://www.nuget.org/packages/OpenAI) this can be problematic because there are conflicting exchange types which can cause confusion.

Agent Framework provides additional support to allow OpenAI developers to use the OpenAI exchange types.
