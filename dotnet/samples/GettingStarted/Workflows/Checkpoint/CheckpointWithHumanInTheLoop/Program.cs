/// <summary>
/// This sample demonstrates how to create a workflow with human-in-the-loop interaction and
/// checkpointing support. The workflow plays a number guessing game where the user provides
/// guesses based on feedback from the workflow. The workflow state is checkpointed at the end
/// of each super step, allowing it to be restored and resumed later.
/// Each InputPort request and response cycle takes two super steps:
/// 1. The InputPort sends a RequestInfoEvent to request input from the external world.
/// 2. The external world sends a response back to the InputPort.
/// Thus, two checkpoints are created for each human-in-the-loop interaction.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Pre-requisites:
/// - Foundational samples should be completed first.
/// - This sample builds upon the HumanInTheLoopBasic sample. It's recommended to go through that
///   sample first to understand the basics of human-in-the-loop workflows.
/// - This sample also builds upon the CheckpointAndResume sample. It's recommended to
///   go through that sample first to understand the basics of checkpointing and resuming workflows.
