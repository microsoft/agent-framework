/// <summary>
/// This sample introduces the concepts of check points and shows how to save and restore
/// the state of a workflow using checkpoints.
/// This sample demonstrates checkpoints, which allow you to save and restore a workflow's state.
/// Key concepts:
/// - Super Steps: A workflow executes in stages called "super steps". Each super step runs
///   one or more executors and completes when all those executors finish their work.
/// - Checkpoints: The system automatically saves the workflow's state at the end of each
///   super step. You can use these checkpoints to resume the workflow from any saved point.
/// - Rehydration: You can rehydrate a new workflow instance from a saved checkpoint, allowing
///   you to continue execution from that point.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Pre-requisites:
/// - Foundational samples should be completed first.
/// </remarks>
