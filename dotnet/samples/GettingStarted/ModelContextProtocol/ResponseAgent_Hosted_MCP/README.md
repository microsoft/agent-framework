# Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- .NET 8.0 SDK or later
- Azure OpenAI service endpoint and deployment configured
- Azure CLI installed and authenticated (for Azure credential authentication)
- User has the `Cognitive Services OpenAI Contributor` role for the Azure OpenAI resource.

$env:AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME="gpt-4.1-mini"  # Optional, defaults to gpt-4.1-mini
```
