# Semantic Kernel Migration Playground

This is a playground folder with Semantic Kernel code examples that can be used to test migration to the new **Agent Framework (AF)**.

## Prompting

Ideally simple prompts can be used to migrate any code, here's an example:

> Migrate my current project to use the new Agent Framework (AF) APIs using the guide in the #SemanticKernelToAgentFramework migration guide.
> 
> Look for other files and external references if needed.
