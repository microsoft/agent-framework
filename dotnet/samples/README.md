# Agent Framework Samples

The agent framework samples are designed to help you get started with building AI-powered agents
from various providers.

The Agent Framework supports building agents using various infererence and inference-style services.
All these are supported using the single `ChatClientAgent` class.

The Agent Framework also supports creating proxy agents, that allow accessing remote agents as if they
were local agents. These are supported using various `AIAgent` subclasses.

## Sample Categories

The samples are subdivided into the following categories:

- [Getting Started Steps](./GettingStartedSteps/README.md): Basic steps to get started with the agent framework.
  These samples demonstrate the fundamental concepts and functionalities of the agent framework when using the
  `ChatClientAgent` and can be used with any underlying service that the `ChatClientAgent` supports.
- [Agent setup](./AgentSetup/README.md): Samples that demonstrate how to create and configure each type of agent that come with the agent framework.
- [Agent specific features](./AgentSpecificFeatures/README.md): Samples that showcase features specific to each type of agent.
