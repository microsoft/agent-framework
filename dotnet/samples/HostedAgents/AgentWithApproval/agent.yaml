displayName: "Microsoft Learn Response Agent with MCP Approval"
description: >
  An AI agent that uses Azure OpenAI Responses with a Hosted Model Context Protocol (MCP) server,
  requiring explicit human approval before each tool invocation. The agent answers questions by
  searching Microsoft Learn documentation using MCP tools, but every tool call must be approved
  by the caller first — demonstrating a human-in-the-loop pattern.
