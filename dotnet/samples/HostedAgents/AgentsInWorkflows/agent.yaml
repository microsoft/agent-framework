  This sample demonstrates how to integrate AI agents into a workflow pipeline and 
  convert the entire workflow into a hosted AI agent.
  
  Three translation agents are connected sequentially to create a translation chain:
  English → French → Spanish → English. This showcases how AI-powered agents can be 
  seamlessly integrated into workflow pipelines and composed as workflow executors.
