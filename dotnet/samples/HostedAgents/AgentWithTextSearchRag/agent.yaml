displayName: "Text Search RAG Agent"
description: |
  This sample demonstrates how to use TextSearchProvider to add retrieval augmented generation (RAG) 
  capabilities to an AI agent. The provider runs a search against an external knowledge base before 
  each model invocation and injects the results into the model context. 
  
  This agent can answer questions about Contoso Outdoors policies and products, including return 
  policies, refunds, shipping options, and product care instructions (e.g., tent maintenance).
