# Agent Framework Foundry

This package contains the Microsoft Foundry integrations for Microsoft Agent Framework, including Foundry chat clients, preconfigured Foundry agents, Foundry embedding clients, and Foundry memory providers.

## Toolboxes

A *toolbox* is a named, versioned bundle of hosted tool configurations — code interpreter, file search, image generation, MCP, web search, and so on — stored inside a Microsoft Foundry project. Toolboxes let you manage tool configuration once and reuse it across agents.

### Authoring a toolbox

Toolboxes can be authored two ways:

- **Foundry portal** — create and version toolboxes through the UI without touching code.
- **Programmatically** — use the [`azure-ai-projects`](https://pypi.org/project/azure-ai-projects/) SDK to create, update, and version toolboxes from Python.

> Toolbox authoring APIs (`ToolboxVersionObject`, `ToolboxObject`, `project_client.beta.toolboxes.*`) require `azure-ai-projects>=2.1.0`. Earlier versions can only consume toolboxes that already exist.

### Using toolboxes with `FoundryAgent`

For hosted `FoundryAgent`, the toolbox must already be attached to the agent in the Microsoft Foundry project. Once attached, the agent invokes its toolbox tools transparently — no client-side wiring required — and you interact with the agent the same way you would with any other tool-equipped Foundry agent.

### Using toolboxes with `FoundryChatClient`

Each toolbox is reachable as an MCP server. Connect to the toolbox's MCP endpoint with `MCPStreamableHTTPTool` — the agent then discovers and calls its tools over MCP at runtime:

```python
from agent_framework import Agent, MCPStreamableHTTPTool
from agent_framework.foundry import FoundryChatClient

async with Agent(
    client=FoundryChatClient(...),
    instructions="You are a helpful assistant. Use the toolbox tools when useful.",
    tools=MCPStreamableHTTPTool(
        name="my_toolbox",
        description="Tools served by my Foundry toolbox",
        url="https://<your-toolbox-mcp-endpoint>",
    ),
) as agent:
    result = await agent.run("What tools are available?")
    print(result.text)
```

## Publishing an agent as a Foundry prompt agent

> **Experimental — `ExperimentalFeature.TO_PROMPT_AGENT`.** `to_prompt_agent`
> is a preview API and may change before reaching GA. It emits an
> `ExperimentalWarning` on first use.

`to_prompt_agent(agent)` converts an `Agent` whose chat client is a
`FoundryChatClient` into a Foundry `PromptAgentDefinition`. The model is lifted
from the bound `FoundryChatClient`, so the same agent definition you run
locally can be published as a hosted prompt agent without restating the model
deployment name.

```python
import asyncio

from agent_framework import Agent
from agent_framework.foundry import FoundryChatClient, to_prompt_agent
from azure.ai.projects.aio import AIProjectClient
from azure.identity.aio import AzureCliCredential


async def main() -> None:
    credential = AzureCliCredential()
    project_endpoint = "https://<your-project>.services.ai.azure.com"

    agent = Agent(
        client=FoundryChatClient(
            project_endpoint=project_endpoint,
            model="gpt-4o",
            credential=credential,
        ),
        name="TravelAgent",
        instructions="You are a helpful travel assistant.",
        tools=[
            FoundryChatClient.get_web_search_tool(),
            FoundryChatClient.get_code_interpreter_tool(),
        ],
    )

    project_client = AIProjectClient(endpoint=project_endpoint, credential=credential)
    await project_client.agents.create_version(
        name="travel-agent",
        definition=to_prompt_agent(agent),
    )


asyncio.run(main())
```

Behaviour:

- `agent.client` must be a `FoundryChatClient` (or subclass) — otherwise the
  converter raises `TypeError`.
- The bound client must have a `model` set — otherwise the converter raises
  `ValueError`.
- Foundry SDK tool instances returned by `FoundryChatClient.get_*_tool()` are
  passed through unchanged.
- AF `FunctionTool` instances (and `@tool`-decorated callables) are emitted as
  Foundry `FunctionTool` **declarations** — the prompt agent receives the
  schema only, not the Python implementation. To execute the function when
  invoking the deployed prompt agent, connect with `FoundryAgent` and pass the
  same callable via `tools=`:

  ```python
  from agent_framework.foundry import FoundryAgent

  deployed = FoundryAgent(
      project_endpoint=project_endpoint,
      agent_name="travel-agent",
      credential=credential,
      tools=[book_hotel],  # same @tool-decorated callable used at publish time
  )
  result = await deployed.run("Book me a hotel in Seattle for 3 nights.")
  ```

  `FoundryAgent` runs the function locally when the prompt agent calls it, so
  the declaration on the server and the implementation on the client stay in
  sync via the shared `@tool` definition.
- Local Agent Framework MCP tools cannot be published as prompt-agent tools —
  the converter raises `ValueError` and points at
  `FoundryChatClient.get_mcp_tool(...)` for hosted MCP servers.

for an end-to-end runnable example.
