"""Purview models package.

Houses pydantic models used by the Purview policy middleware. Public imports should
prefer the re-export surface in ``agent_framework_purview._models`` to keep a stable
API surface. This module exists to make the directory an explicit package and
prevent implicit namespace package warnings from linters.
