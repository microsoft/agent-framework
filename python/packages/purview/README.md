## Microsoft Agent Framework â€“ Purview Integration (Python)

`agent-framework-purview` adds Microsoft Purview (Microsoft Graph dataSecurityAndGovernance) policy evaluation to the Microsoft Agent Framework. It lets you enforce data security / governance policies on both the *prompt* (user input + conversation history) and the *model response* before they proceed further in your workflow.

> Status: **Preview**

### Key Features

- Middleware-based policy enforcement (agent-level and chat-client level)
- Blocks or allows content at both ingress (prompt) and egress (response)
- Works with any `ChatAgent` / agent orchestration using the standard Agent Framework middleware pipeline
- Supports both synchronous `TokenCredential` and `AsyncTokenCredential` from `azure-identity`
- Configuration via `PurviewSettings` / `PurviewAppLocation`
- Built-in caching with configurable TTL and size limits for protection scopes in `PurviewSettings`
- Background processing for content activities and offline policy evaluation

### When to Use
Add Purview when you need to:

- **Prevent sensitive data leaks**: Inline blocking of sensitive content based on Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies.
- **Enable governance**: Log AI interactions in Purview for Audit, Communication Compliance, Insider Risk Management, eDiscovery, and Data Lifecycle Management.
- Prevent sensitive or disallowed content from being sent to an LLM
- Prevent model output containing disallowed data from leaving the system
- Apply centrally managed policies without rewriting agent logic

## Prerequisites

- Microsoft Azure subscription with Microsoft Purview configured.
- Microsoft 365 subscription with an E5 license and pay-as-you-go billing setup.
  - For testing, you can use a Microsoft 365 Developer Program tenant. For more information, see [Join the Microsoft 365 Developer Program](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/dev-program).

### Authentication

`PurviewClient` uses the `azure-identity` library for token acquisition. You can use any `TokenCredential` or `AsyncTokenCredential` implementation.

- **Entra registration**: Register your agent and add the required Microsoft Graph permissions (`dataSecurityAndGovernance`) to the Service Principal. For more information, see [Register an application in Microsoft Entra ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-register-app) and [dataSecurityAndGovernance resource type](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/datasecurityandgovernance). You'll need the Microsoft Entra app ID in the next step.

- **Graph Permissions**:
- ProtectionScopes.Compute.All : [userProtectionScopeContainer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/userprotectionscopecontainer-compute)
- Content.Process.All : [processContent](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/userdatasecurityandgovernance-processcontent)
- ContentActivity.Write : [contentActivity](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/activitiescontainer-post-contentactivities)

- **Purview policies**: Configure Purview policies using the Microsoft Entra app ID to enable agent communications data to flow into Purview. For more information, see [Configure Microsoft Purview](https://learn.microsoft.com/purview/developer/configurepurview).

#### Scopes
`PurviewSettings.get_scopes()` derives the Graph scope list (currently `https://graph.microsoft.com/.default` style).

## Quick Start

```python
import asyncio
from agent_framework import ChatAgent, ChatMessage, Role
from agent_framework.azure import AzureOpenAIChatClient
from agent_framework.microsoft import PurviewPolicyMiddleware, PurviewSettings
from azure.identity import InteractiveBrowserCredential

async def main():
	chat_client = AzureOpenAIChatClient()  # uses environment for endpoint + deployment

	purview_middleware = PurviewPolicyMiddleware(
		credential=InteractiveBrowserCredential(),
		settings=PurviewSettings(app_name="My Sample App")
	)

	agent = ChatAgent(
		chat_client=chat_client,
		instructions="You are a helpful assistant.",
		middleware=[purview_middleware]
	)

	response = await agent.run(ChatMessage(role=Role.USER, text="Summarize zero trust in one sentence."))
	print(response)

asyncio.run(main())
```

If a policy violation is detected on the prompt, the middleware terminates the run and substitutes a system message: `"Prompt blocked by policy"`. If on the response, the result becomes `"Response blocked by policy"`.

---

## Configuration

### `PurviewSettings`

```python
PurviewSettings(
    app_name="My App",                         # Required: Display / logical name
    app_version=None,                          # Optional: Version string of the application
    tenant_id=None,                            # Optional: Tenant id (guid), used mainly for auth context
    purview_app_location=None,                 # Optional: PurviewAppLocation for scoping
    graph_base_uri="https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/",
    blocked_prompt_message="Prompt blocked by policy",      # Custom message for blocked prompts
    blocked_response_message="Response blocked by policy",  # Custom message for blocked responses
    ignore_exceptions=False,                   # If True, non-payment exceptions are logged but not thrown
    ignore_payment_required=False,             # If True, 402 payment required errors are logged but not thrown
    cache_ttl_seconds=14400,                   # Cache TTL in seconds (default 4 hours)
    max_cache_size_bytes=200 * 1024 * 1024     # Max cache size in bytes (default 200MB)
)
```

### Caching

The Purview integration includes built-in caching for protection scopes responses to improve performance and reduce API calls:

- **Default TTL**: 4 hours (14400 seconds)
- **Default Cache Size**: 200MB
- **Cache Provider**: `InMemoryCacheProvider` is used by default, but you can provide a custom implementation via the `CacheProvider` protocol
- **Cache Invalidation**: Cache is automatically invalidated when protection scope state is modified
- **Exception Caching**: 402 Payment Required errors are cached to avoid repeated failed API calls

You can customize caching behavior in `PurviewSettings`:

```python
from agent_framework.microsoft import PurviewSettings

settings = PurviewSettings(
    app_name="My App",
    cache_ttl_seconds=14400,           # 4 hours
    max_cache_size_bytes=200 * 1024 * 1024  # 200MB
)
```

Or provide your own cache provider:

```python
from typing import Any
from agent_framework.microsoft import PurviewPolicyMiddleware, PurviewSettings, CacheProvider
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential

class MyCustomCache(CacheProvider):
    async def get(self, key: str) -> Any | None:
        # Your implementation
        pass
    
    async def set(self, key: str, value: Any, ttl_seconds: int | None = None) -> None:
        # Your implementation
        pass
    
    async def remove(self, key: str) -> None:
        # Your implementation
        pass

credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
settings = PurviewSettings(app_name="MyApp")

middleware = PurviewPolicyMiddleware(
    credential=credential,
    settings=settings,
    cache_provider=MyCustomCache()
)
```

To scope evaluation by location (application, URL, or domain):

```python
from agent_framework.microsoft import (
	PurviewAppLocation,
	PurviewLocationType,
	PurviewSettings,
)

settings = PurviewSettings(
	app_name="Contoso Support",
	purview_app_location=PurviewAppLocation(
		location_type=PurviewLocationType.APPLICATION,
		location_value="<app-client-id>"
	)
)
```

### Customizing Blocked Messages

By default, when Purview blocks a prompt or response, the middleware returns a generic system message. You can customize these messages by providing your own text in the `PurviewSettings`:

```python
from agent_framework.microsoft import PurviewSettings

settings = PurviewSettings(
	app_name="My App",
	blocked_prompt_message="Your request contains content that violates our policies. Please rephrase and try again.",
	blocked_response_message="The response was blocked due to policy restrictions. Please contact support if you need assistance."
)
```

### Exception Handling Controls

The Purview integration provides fine-grained control over exception handling to support graceful degradation scenarios:

```python
from agent_framework.microsoft import PurviewSettings

# Ignore all non-payment exceptions (continue execution even if policy check fails)
settings = PurviewSettings(
    app_name="My App",
    ignore_exceptions=True  # Log errors but don't throw
)

# Ignore only 402 Payment Required errors (useful for tenants without proper licensing)
settings = PurviewSettings(
    app_name="My App",
    ignore_payment_required=True  # Continue even without Purview Consumptive Billing Setup
)

# Both can be combined
settings = PurviewSettings(
    app_name="My App",
    ignore_exceptions=True,
    ignore_payment_required=True
)
```

### Selecting Agent vs Chat Middleware

Use the agent middleware when you already have / want the full agent pipeline:

```python
from agent_framework import ChatAgent
from agent_framework.azure import AzureOpenAIChatClient
from agent_framework.microsoft import PurviewPolicyMiddleware, PurviewSettings
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential

credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
client = AzureOpenAIChatClient()

agent = ChatAgent(
	chat_client=client,
	instructions="You are helpful.",
	middleware=[PurviewPolicyMiddleware(credential, PurviewSettings(app_name="My App"))]
)
```

Use the chat middleware when you attach directly to a chat client (e.g. minimal agent shell or custom orchestration):

```python
import os
from agent_framework import ChatAgent
from agent_framework.azure import AzureOpenAIChatClient
from agent_framework.microsoft import PurviewChatPolicyMiddleware, PurviewSettings
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential

credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

chat_client = AzureOpenAIChatClient(
	deployment_name=os.environ["AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME"],
	endpoint=os.environ["AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT"],
	credential=credential,
	middleware=[
		PurviewChatPolicyMiddleware(credential, PurviewSettings(app_name="My App (Chat)"))
	],
)

agent = ChatAgent(chat_client=chat_client, instructions="You are helpful.")
```

The policy logic is identical; the difference is only the hook point in the pipeline.

---

## Middleware Lifecycle

1. **Before agent execution** (`prompt phase`): all `context.messages` are evaluated.
   - If no valid user_id is found, processing is skipped (no policy evaluation)
   - Protection scopes are retrieved (with caching)
   - Applicable scopes are checked to determine execution mode
   - In inline mode: content is evaluated immediately
   - In offline mode: evaluation is queued in background
2. **If blocked**: `context.result` is replaced with a system message and `context.terminate = True`.
3. **After successful agent execution** (`response phase`): the produced messages are evaluated using the same user_id from the prompt phase.
4. **If blocked**: result messages are replaced with a blocking notice.

The user identifier is discovered from `ChatMessage.additional_properties['user_id']` during the prompt phase and reused for the response phase, ensuring both evaluations map consistently to the same user. If no user_id is present, policy evaluation is skipped entirely.

You can customize the blocking messages using the `blocked_prompt_message` and `blocked_response_message` fields in `PurviewSettings`. For more advanced scenarios, you can wrap the middleware or post-process `context.result` in later middleware.

## Exceptions

| Exception | Scenario |
|-----------|----------|
| `PurviewPaymentRequiredError` | 402 Payment Required - tenant lacks proper Purview licensing or consumptive billing setup |
| `PurviewAuthenticationError` | Token acquisition / validation issues |
| `PurviewRateLimitError` | 429 responses from service |
| `PurviewRequestError` | 4xx client errors (bad input, unauthorized, forbidden) |
| `PurviewServiceError` | 5xx or unexpected service errors |

### Exception Handling

All exceptions inherit from `PurviewServiceError`. You can catch specific exceptions or use the base class:

```python
from agent_framework.microsoft import (
    PurviewPaymentRequiredError,
    PurviewAuthenticationError, 
    PurviewRateLimitError,
    PurviewRequestError, 
    PurviewServiceError
)

try:
    # Your code here
    pass
except PurviewPaymentRequiredError as ex:
    # Handle licensing issues specifically
    print(f"Purview licensing required: {ex}")
except (PurviewAuthenticationError, PurviewRateLimitError, PurviewRequestError, PurviewServiceError) as ex:
    # Handle other errors
    print(f"Purview enforcement skipped: {ex}")
```

---

## Notes
- **User Identification**: Provide a `user_id` per request (e.g. in `ChatMessage(..., additional_properties={"user_id": "<guid>"})`) for per-user policy scoping. If no user_id is provided, policy evaluation is skipped entirely.
- **Blocking Messages**: Can be customized via `blocked_prompt_message` and `blocked_response_message` in `PurviewSettings`. By default, they are "Prompt blocked by policy" and "Response blocked by policy" respectively.
- **Streaming Responses**: Post-response policy evaluation presently applies only to non-streaming chat responses.
- **Error Handling**: Use `ignore_exceptions` and `ignore_payment_required` settings for graceful degradation. When enabled, errors are logged but don't fail the request.
- **Caching**: Protection scopes responses and 402 errors are cached by default with a 4-hour TTL. Cache is automatically invalidated when protection scope state changes.
- **Background Processing**: Content Activities and offline Process Content requests are handled asynchronously using background tasks to avoid blocking the main execution flow.
