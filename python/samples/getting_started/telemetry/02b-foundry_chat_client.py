This sample, shows you can leverage the built-in telemetry in Foundry.
It uses the Foundry client to setup the telemetry, this calls
out to Foundry for a telemetry connection strings,
and then call the setup_telemetry function in the agent framework.
If you want to compare with the trace sent to a generic OTLP endpoint,
switch the `use_foundry_telemetry` variable to False.
