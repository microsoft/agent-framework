Expected Output:
============================================================
Step 1: Call divide(10, 0) - tool raises exception
    Tool failed with error: division by zero
[2025-10-31 15:39:53 - /Users/edvan/Work/agent-framework/python/packages/core/agent_framework/_tools.py:718 - ERROR]
Function failed. Error: division by zero
Response: Division by zero is undefined in standard arithmetic. There is no finite value for 10 ÷ 0.

If you want alternatives:
- A valid example: 10 ÷ 2 = 5.
- To handle safely in code, you can check the denominator first (e.g., in Python: if b == 0:
    handle error else: compute a/b).
- If you’re curious about limits: as x → 0+, 10/x → +∞; as x → 0−, 10/x → −∞; there is no finite limit.

Would you like me to show a safe division snippet in a specific language, or compute something else?
============================================================
Step 2: Call divide(100, 0) - will refuse to execute due to max_invocations
[2025-10-31 15:40:09 - /Users/edvan/Work/agent-framework/python/packages/core/agent_framework/_tools.py:718 - ERROR]
Function failed. Error: Function 'safe_divide' has reached its maximum exception limit, you tried to use this
tool too many times and it kept failing.
Response: Division by zero is undefined in standard arithmetic, so 100 ÷ 0 has no finite value.

If you’re coding and want safe handling, here are quick patterns in a few languages:

- Python
  def safe_divide(a, b):
      if b == 0:
          return None  # or raise an exception
      return a / b

  safe_divide(100, 0)  # -> None

- JavaScript
  function safeDivide(a, b) {
      if (b === 0) return undefined; // or throw
      return a / b;
  }

  safeDivide(100, 0)  // -> undefined

- Java
  public static Double safeDivide(double a, double b) {
      if (b == 0.0) throw new ArithmeticException("Divide by zero");
      return a / b;
  }

  safeDivide(100, 0)  // -> exception

- C/C++
  double safeDivide(double a, double b) {
      if (b == 0.0) return std::numeric_limits<double>::infinity(); // or handle error
      return a / b;
  }

Note: In many languages, dividing by zero with floating-point numbers yields Infinity (or -Infinity) or NaN,
but integer division typically raises an error.

Would you like a snippet in a specific language or to see a math explanation (limits) for what happens as the
divisor approaches zero?
