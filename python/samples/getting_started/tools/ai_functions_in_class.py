Expected Output:
============================================================
Step 1: Call divide(10, 0) - tool returns infinity
Response: Division by zero is undefined in standard arithmetic. There is no real number that equals 10 divided by 0.

- If you look at limits: as x → 0+ (denominator approaches 0 from the positive side), 10/x → +∞; as x → 0−, 10/x → −∞.
- Some calculators may display "infinity" or give an error, but that's not a real number.

If you want a numeric surrogate, you can use a small nonzero denominator, e.g., 10/0.001 = 10000. Would you like to
see more on limits or handle it with a tiny epsilon?
============================================================
Step 2: Call set safe to False and call again
[2025-10-31 16:17:44 - /Users/edvan/Work/agent-framework/python/packages/core/agent_framework/_tools.py:718 - ERROR]
Function failed. Error: division by zero
Response: Division by zero is undefined in standard arithmetic. There is no number y such that 0 × y = 10.

If you’re looking at limits:
- as x → 0+, 10/x → +∞
- as x → 0−, 10/x → −∞
So the limit does not exist.

In programming, dividing by zero usually raises an error or results in special values (e.g., NaN or ∞) depending
on the language.

If you want, tell me what you’d like to do instead (e.g., compute 10 divided by 2, or handle division by zero safely
in code), and I can help with examples.
