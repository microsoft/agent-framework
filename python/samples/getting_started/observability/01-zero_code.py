"""
This is the simplest sample of using the Agent Framework with telemetry.

This relies on the environment setting up the telemetry, you can test this with
by navigating to this folder and running:
uv run --env-file=zero_code.env opentelemetry-instrument python 01-zero_code.py

Check the zero_code.env file for the settings used in this example and to adapt it to your environment.

    This function runs an AI service and prints the output.

    Remarks:
        When function calling is outside the open telemetry loop
        each of the call to the model is handled as a seperate span,
        while when the open telemetry is put last, a single span
        is shown, which might include one or more rounds of function calling.

        2 spans with gen_ai.operation.name=chat
            The first has finish_reason "tool_calls"
            The second has finish_reason "stop"
