Let's confirm the total cost for upgrading to Business Class under 3 hours ceiling:\n\n- **NM1VX1**: Total Flight Duration of 4 hours 15 minutes, cost of Business Class will be calculated as $0.01/mile which is roughly $120 (costs in miles for same distance will be $14 per mile, due to different distance/airfare then origin/destination cost computations, this value below mentioned)\n- **KC18K6**: Total Flight Duration of 5 hours, cost of Business Class is $0.01/mile which is roughly $150\n- **S61CZX**: Total Flight Duration of 2 hours 15 minutes, cost of Business Class is $0.01/mile which is roughly $50\n- **H8Q05L**: Total Flight Duration of 5 hours 5 minutes, cost of Business Class is $0.01/mile which is roughly $100 (HND to SJN)\n- **WUNA5K**: Total Flight Duration of 3 hours, cost of Business Class is calculated based on Amsterdam to Singapore as calculating a direct flight from Frankfurt will not qualify as 3 hours.\n\nWould you like to proceed with the below forecasted calculations:\n\n- **NM1VX1**: $120\n- **KC18K6**: $150\n- **S61CZX**: $50\n- **H8Q05L**: $100\n- **WUNA5K**: $0 (as I wasn\u2019t sure but landing destination qualifying as 3 hours)\n\nHow are these figures calculated and will apply the correct lodging expenses, or we proceed with this now for future plans?
