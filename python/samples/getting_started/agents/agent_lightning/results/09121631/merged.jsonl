Let's confirm the total cost for upgrading to Business Class under 3 hours ceiling:\n\n- **NM1VX1**: Total Flight Duration of 4 hours 15 minutes, cost of Business Class will be calculated as $0.01/mile which is roughly $120 (costs in miles for same distance will be $14 per mile, due to different distance/airfare then origin/destination cost computations, this value below mentioned)\n- **KC18K6**: Total Flight Duration of 5 hours, cost of Business Class is $0.01/mile which is roughly $150\n- **S61CZX**: Total Flight Duration of 2 hours 15 minutes, cost of Business Class is $0.01/mile which is roughly $50\n- **H8Q05L**: Total Flight Duration of 5 hours 5 minutes, cost of Business Class is $0.01/mile which is roughly $100 (HND to SJN)\n- **WUNA5K**: Total Flight Duration of 3 hours, cost of Business Class is calculated based on Amsterdam to Singapore as calculating a direct flight from Frankfurt will not qualify as 3 hours.\n\nWould you like to proceed with the below forecasted calculations:\n\n- **NM1VX1**: $120\n- **KC18K6**: $150\n- **S61CZX**: $50\n- **H8Q05L**: $100\n- **WUNA5K**: $0 (as I wasn\u2019t sure but landing destination qualifying as 3 hours)\n\nHow are these figures calculated and will apply the correct lodging expenses, or we proceed with this now for future plans? Your calculation in the above will confirm future expenses including upgrading and possible business class fares for you.
