"""OpenAI Responses Client Streaming Image Generation Example

Demonstrates streaming partial image generation using OpenAI's image generation tool.
Shows progressive image rendering with partial images for improved user experience.

Note: The number of partial images received depends on generation speed:
- High quality/complex images: More partials (generation takes longer)
- Low quality/simple images: Fewer partials (generation completes quickly)
- You may receive fewer partial images than requested if generation is fast
