OpenAI Assistants with Existing Assistant Example

This sample demonstrates how to use an existing OpenAI Assistant with the agent framework.
The example includes:

- Creating a new assistant programmatically with custom tools
- Connecting to existing assistants by ID for reuse
- Function calling with custom business logic
- Assistant lifecycle management and cleanup
- Integration with pre-configured OpenAI assistants

This approach is ideal for scenarios where you have pre-built assistants
with specific configurations, tools, and training that you want to reuse
across multiple agent framework applications.
