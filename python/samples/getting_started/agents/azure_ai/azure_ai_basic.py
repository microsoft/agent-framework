Azure AI Agent Basic Example

This sample demonstrates the fundamental usage of Azure AI Agents with the Agent Framework.
The example includes:

- Creating agents using AzureAIAgentClient with automatic agent lifecycle management
- Function tool integration (weather function) for enhanced agent capabilities
- Non-streaming response example to get complete results at once
- Streaming response example to receive results as they are generated
- Automatic agent creation and cleanup using context managers
- Async credential handling with proper resource management
