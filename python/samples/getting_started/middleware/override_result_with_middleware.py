"""
Result Override with Middleware

This sample demonstrates how to use middleware to intercept and modify function results
after execution. The example shows:

- How to execute the original function first and then modify its result
- Replacing function outputs with custom messages or transformed data
- Using middleware for result filtering, formatting, or enhancement

The weather override middleware lets the original weather function execute normally,
then replaces its result with a custom "perfect weather" message, demonstrating
how middleware can be used for content filtering, A/B testing, or result enhancement.
