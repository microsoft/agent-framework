"""
Agents In A Workflow

What it does:
- Wraps two Azure agents in `AgentExecutor`s (writer -> reviewer) and streams their runs.
- Demonstrates building and running a simple agent-to-agent pipeline.

Prerequisites:
- Azure AI/ Azure OpenAI configured for `AzureChatClient`.
- Authentication via `azure-identity` â€” this sample uses `AzureCliCredential()` (run `az login`).
