Step 2: Agents in a Workflow non-streaming

This sample uses two custom executors. A Writer agent creates or edits content,
then hands the conversation to a Reviewer agent which evaluates and finalizes the result.

Purpose:
Show how to wrap chat agents created by AzureChatClient inside workflow executors. Demonstrate the @handler pattern
with typed inputs and typed WorkflowContext[T] outputs, connect executors with the fluent WorkflowBuilder, and finish
by emitting a WorkflowCompletedEvent from the terminal node.

Prerequisites:
- Azure OpenAI configured for AzureChatClient with required environment variables.
- Authentication via azure-identity. Use AzureCliCredential and run az login before executing the sample.
- Basic familiarity with WorkflowBuilder, executors, edges, events, and streaming or non streaming runs.
