# Workflow Getting Started Samples

## Installation

To install the base `agent_framework.workflow` package, please run:

```bash
pip install agent-framework-workflow
```

You can install the workflow package with visualization dependency:

```bash
pip install agent-framework-workflow[viz]
```

To export visualization images you also need to [install GraphViz](https://graphviz.org/download/).

## Samples Overview

## Foundational Concepts - Start Here

Begin with the `foundational` folder in order. These three samples introduce the core ideas of executors, edges, agents in workflows, and streaming.

| Sample | File | Concepts |
|--------|------|----------|
| Executors and Edges | [foundational/step1_executors_and_edges.py](./foundational/step1_executors_and_edges.py) | Minimal workflow with basic executors and edges |
| Agents in a Workflow | [foundational/step2_agents_in_a_workflow.py](./foundational/step2_agents_in_a_workflow.py) | Introduces `AgentExecutor`; calling agents inside a workflow |
| Streaming | [foundational/step3_streaming.py](./foundational/step3_streaming.py) | Extends workflows with event streaming |

Once comfortable with these, explore the rest of the samples.

Notes
- Agentâ€‘based samples use provider SDKs (Azure/OpenAI, etc.). Ensure credentials are configured, or adapt agents accordingly.

### Environment Variables

- **AzureChatClient**: Set Azure OpenAI environment variables as documented [here](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework/blob/main/python/samples/getting_started/chat_client/README.md#environment-variables).  
  These variables are required for samples that construct `AzureChatClient`

- **OpenAI** (used in orchestration samples):  
  - [OpenAIChatClient env vars](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework/blob/main/python/samples/getting_started/agents/openai_chat_client/README.md)  
  - [OpenAIResponsesClient env vars](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework/blob/main/python/samples/getting_started/agents/openai_responses_client/README.md)
