OpenAI Chat Client Direct Usage Example

This sample demonstrates direct usage of OpenAIChatClient for chat interactions
with OpenAI models without agent orchestration. The example includes:

- Direct chat client instantiation with OpenAI API
- Function calling capabilities with custom business logic
- Type-safe function definitions with Pydantic
- Simple OpenAI API key authentication
- Flexible model selection and configuration

Direct chat client usage is ideal for simple conversational scenarios
with function calling where you need OpenAI model access without
agent complexity, perfect for lightweight chat applications.
