OpenAI Responses Client Direct Usage Example

This sample demonstrates direct usage of OpenAIResponsesClient for structured
response generation with OpenAI models without agent orchestration. The example includes:

- Direct responses client instantiation with OpenAI API
- Function calling capabilities with custom business logic
- Type-safe function definitions with Pydantic
- Simple OpenAI API key authentication
- Streamlined response generation and processing

Direct responses client usage provides streamlined access to OpenAI
models for applications requiring direct response generation with function
calling without the complexity of agent workflows or advanced orchestration.
