Azure OpenAI Responses Client Direct Usage Example

This sample demonstrates direct usage of AzureOpenAIResponsesClient for structured
response generation with Azure OpenAI models without agent orchestration. The example includes:

- Direct responses client instantiation with Azure OpenAI endpoints
- Function calling capabilities with custom business logic
- Azure CLI credential authentication
- Type-safe function definitions and response models with Pydantic
- Structured response generation and parsing

Direct responses client usage provides streamlined access to Azure OpenAI
models for applications requiring direct response generation with function
calling without the complexity of agent workflows or advanced orchestration.
