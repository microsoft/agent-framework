cloud storage like S3, Azure Blob Storage, or Google Cloud Storage.

    Features:
    - Stores files in a local uploads directory
    - Generates upload URLs for two-phase upload
    - Generates preview URLs for images
    - Proper cleanup on deletion

    Note: This is for demonstration purposes. In production, use cloud storage
