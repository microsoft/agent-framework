This demo showcases an agent that has access to a MCP tool that can talk to the Microsoft Learn documentation platform, hosted as an agent endpoint running locally in a Docker container.

## What the Project Does

This project demonstrates how to:

- Create an agent with a hosted MCP tool using the Agent Framework
- Host the agent as an agent endpoint running in a Docker container

## Prerequisites

- Required environment variables (see Configuration section)

## Configuration
