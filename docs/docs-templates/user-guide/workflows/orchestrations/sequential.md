# Microsoft Agent Framework Workflows Orchestrations: Sequential

In sequential orchestration, agents are organized in a pipeline. Each agent processes the task in turn, passing its output to the next agent in the sequence. This is ideal for workflows where each step builds upon the previous one, such as document review, data processing pipelines, or multi-stage reasoning.
