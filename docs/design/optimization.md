# Optimization and Tuning

> For future consideration.

The framework should support optimization of agents and workflows
with task feedback, by tuning the various components such as 
system prompts, model parameters, and tool configurations.

We should also consider fine-tuning of the models and embeddings
as part of the optimization process.
